Single Page Notes App

This is a single-page notes app allowing users to view news headlines, and have it
appear in a list. News headlines can then be expanded to show the article.

We were asked to create a testing framework in Javascript from scratch. Once the framework had been completed we could then use it to test or applicaion.

## <a name="Framework">Testing Framework</a>
the repo includes a bespoke testing framework written from scratch.

### Installation
To install to any project
```
$ git clone https://github.com/thesedatedprince/news-app
$ cd news-app
$ http-server
$ open -a safari localhost:8080/test.html
```

### usage

In order add additional tests to the app, please do the following:

```
1. Create a new test file in /spec, using JavaScript naming conventions.

2. Add this file to the head of test.html along with the file being tested.

3. Add your tests to your new spec file.

4. Open/refresh test.html in browser to see the outcome of these tests.
```

The testing framework follows these syntax conventions:

```
1. A describe block containing a description of the testing suite.

2. An it block describing the test to be run.
```

Example syntax of a simple describe/it block:
```js
describe("Test suite 1", function() {
  it('returns HELLO', function(){
    return assert.Equals(returnTrue(),true);
  });
});

```

### matchers
The following matchers are present in this testing framework:

```
Equals: Returns true if argument A is equal to argument B.
NotEquals: Returns true argument A is not equal to argument B.
GreaterThan: Returns true if argument A is greater than argument B.
LessThan: Returns true if argument A is less than argument B.
Contains: Returns true if argument A contains argument B.
HasContent: Returns true if argument A has content from argument B.
```

### custom fail messages
You can add a custom fail message by replacing argument C in the test:

```js
describe("Test suite 1", function() {
  it('returns HELLO', function(){
    return assert.Equals(returnTrue(),"HELLO", ":(");
  });
});
```

This will now return ":(" on fail.
